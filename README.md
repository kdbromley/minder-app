# 'minder App
First fullstack capstone for my Software Engineering program at Thinkful. 
A simple reminders application to demonstrate my skills thus far.

The live app can be found at https://minder-app.vercel.app/

## Use
The app currently only functions with a single default 'dummy user' to demonstrate functionality. Authorization and user accounts are future features. Various security measures have been put in place, including using Helmet.js and santitizing server-side to prevent XSS attacks.

## Tools
This front end application was made using
-React framework
-JSX
-Javascript
-HTML
-CSS

The backend (https://github.com/kdbromley/minder-app-api) consists of an Express server and Heroku PostgreSQL database.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
